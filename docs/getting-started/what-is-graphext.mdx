Just as a quick overview, you can:

- get a bird's eye view of your data upon just uploading it
- clean up the data with the help of AI, [merging similar categories](/tutorials/merge-categories) or [guessing the
  country of a given city](/tutorials/prompt-ai-countries)
- [make predictions](/documentation/machine-learning/predictive-models) on it through well tested and robust mathematical models
- [holistic enrichment](documentation/data-preparation/data-enrichments) of your data for more precise answers to potentially ambiguous questions.

just to name a few.
