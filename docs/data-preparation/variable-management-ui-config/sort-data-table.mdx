As any table you might have dealt with, the Data Table can be sorted by any given column,
given that the column has a way to be ordered.

To do this, simply reach out to the column menu and go to Sort. Then choose whether you want
ascending or descending order.

<Frame>
  ![Sorting the table](/images/variable-management/sort-column.webp)
</Frame>

This will sort all the rows based on the columns ordering.

:::note
  For columns that do not present a clear ordering, sorting will be done
  alphabetically. This applies to `category`, and `text`.

<Tip>
  If you have a categorical variable that has a clear ordering but it doesn't
  sort properly, check how to convert it to an **ordinal variable** by
  [specifying the ordering in categorical
  variables](/documentation/data-preparation/variable-management-ui-config/specify-order-in-column).

Examples of this kind of variables are **shirt sizes**, where "S" is smaller than "M", which is smaller than "L", or
**survey answers** like "Disagree" which is smaller than "Don't Mind/Don't Know", which is smaller than
"Agree".
