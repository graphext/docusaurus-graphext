The left and right sidebars display the cross filter for each of the variables
present in your data. They're sorted in the same way the original columns are sorted
when imported. We can change this order to our liking.

In order to change the order in which the variables in the left
and right sidebars appear, we must go to the Variable Manager.

<Frame>
  <video

  />
</Frame>

From there, we can simply drag and drop them, arranging them in whatever order we
find most useful.

<Tip>
  You can click on the 3 display buttons to the right of the search bar. This
  will display the cards with different levels of detail. The right-most button
  will display very small cards that only include the name, which displays much
  more variables on view and makes it a lot easier to handle.

After that, click save in the lower right corner of the screen to save your changes.
