title: Specifying order in categorical variables

It is common to have a categorical column whose values have a clear order. This can
be shirt sizes, like "S", "M", "L" or "XL". The category "L" is _greater_ than "M".

In order to provide with this contextual order to a categorical variable, we must proceed
using the [Recipe](/concepts/graphext-concepts/recipe) and writing a [step](/concepts/graphext-concepts/steps) for it. Currently, there is no way to do it through
the interface, though we have plans to add this functionality soon.

## Intro and Resources

To do this, we are going to use the [order_categories](/api-docs/prepare/transform/order_categories) step.
You can follow [this example](https://app.graphext.com/projects/UHJvamVjdC05ODA3MA==/v/data).

Also, a video tutorial is available to do this exact process in the Titanic Data set.
You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/kM9KCq5K2nw?t=239&si=-CG2PA6UVZS8kAAE) in case it makes it easier to follow.

## Open the Recipe

Reach out to the little scroll icon in the top right corner.

## Enable Code Mode

This will allow us to see and edit the code.

## Search for the order_categories step

Start writing `ord`, and the list will show the `order_categories` step.
Press enter, tab or click on the suggestion to accept it.

</Frame>

This operation will write this piece of code on the same line:

```erlang
order_categories(ds.input) -> (ds.output)
```

## Edit the step with your column name

Because the column we want to take the information from is called `size` (careful, it's case sensitive!),
we change the code so it looks like this:

```erlang
order_categories(ds.size) -> (ds.size)
```

This gives an error because we are trying to create a column that already exists, `size`. We can either
create a new column with the ordering applied, or we can **overwrite** the existing column to include
the ordering information.

To create a new column, simply change the output from size to any other name, for example:

```erlang
order_categories(ds.size) -> (ds.size_ordered)
```

To overwrite the colum, we use the overwrite operator, like this:

```erlang
order_categories(ds.size) => (ds.size)
                          ^ this changed from - to =
```

## Apply the ordering

Let's apply the ordering. To do this, edit the step like this:

```erlang
order_categories(ds.size,
    {"categories": ["XXL", "XXXL", "L", "M", "S", "XXS"]}
) => (ds.size)
```

All we did is create an options object with `{}` that has a field `categories`. This field expects a list
of categories present in our data, and we pass in the order we want, **bigger/greater first**, and in
decreasing order.

<Tip>
  You can basically copy this piece of code and substitute "size" for the name
  of your column, and the categories list by all the different categories just
  like here: each in between quote marks and separated by commas.
</Tip>

## Done!

Now, we click "Run" in the lower right corner to save.
We can now see that our variable Size has a sorting icon next to it, allowing us to [sort the whole table](/documentation/data-preparation/variable-management-ui-config/sort-data-table).
