The Data Table in Graphext is really flexible, and allows for great manipulation. Columns
can be rearranged, which is convenient when trying to compare and contrast data.

There are a couple of ways to arrange columns in the Data Table:

## Dragging columns

Quickest and most intuitive way to put a column where
it needs to be is to simply **grab and drag it**.

    loop
    src="/images/variable-management/rearrange-columns.mp4"
  />
</Frame>

## Sending a column first or last

You can also move columns directly to the first or last position, by using the column
settings menu.

<Frame>
  ![Rearrange column menu](/images/variable-management/move-column-menu.webp)
</Frame>

This is particularly convenient when you create predictive models or use the Recipe,
processes that create new columns that are usually very interesting to analyze. These columns end up
last. To avoid having to drag the column all the way through, simply send it first and then
reorder there.

Other times, we usually send columns last as a way to _hide_ them from the view. It's up to you!

## Arranging columns in the Variable Manager

Both of these processes can be performed in the Variable Manager. Drag a variable card to put it in a new
position, or send it first/last using the arrow icons in the top right corner of each card.
