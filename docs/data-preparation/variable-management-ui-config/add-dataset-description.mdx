Adding information to your dataset is a very good practice. Adding a description of what the data
describes and a source of where you found it is always convenient for reproducibility, and to
keep everyone on the same page, even your future self.

## Adding a description and sources to your data

To add a description and a source, click the Dataset Info button,

This will expand two text fields in which you can add a description and a link to the
dataset source.
