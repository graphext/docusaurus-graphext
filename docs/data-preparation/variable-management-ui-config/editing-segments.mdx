After creating a [segment](/concepts/graphext-concepts/segments), it will be named with a sum up of the set
of filters you composed it from. This name can be edited to your liking
for easier understanding of it.

## Enabling edit mode

To edit a segment, click the Edit Properties button in the top right corner of the segment.

## Edit the names and/or colors of each segment

This will enable Edit Mode on the segment. You can now click on any of the segments to edit them
(1), change the name of the segment (2), optionally change their color, and finally apply the changes
by clicking the apply button or hitting the Enter key (3).

Repeat this process for any segments you want to modify. After that, click the Save button to save all
your changes.

## Editing a categorical variable

Categorical variables behave in much the same way, or, put it the other way around: segments are a kind of
categorical (multivalued) variable we create out of a set of filters.

This means that the cross filter corresponding to any categorical variable can also be edited.
