[Tags](/concepts/graphext-concepts/tags) are a powerful way of organizing your variables, ane especially useful on
datasets with lots of related variables.

## Adding tags

There are two main ways we can add tags to a variable: using the Variable Manager
or using a Step in the Recipe.

### Using the Variable Manager

Here's an example where we create the "host" tag in one variable, and then select multiple variables to apply the
tag to all of them in one step.

<Frame>
  <video
    controls
    playsInline
    autoPlay
    loop
    muted
    src="/images/using-tags.mp4"
  />
</Frame>

### As a Step in the Recipe

The step <kbd>[configure_tagged_columns](/api-docs/report/configure_ui/configure_tagged_columns)</kbd> will
allow you to tag every column passed with a tag of your choice.

```erlang
configure_tagged_columns(ds.columna, ds.columnb, { "tag": "very important" })
```

### Using the tagged columns in the recipe

Sometimes it's useful to process all the columns belonging to a tag using a step.

You can copy all variable names belonging to a particular tag by selecting the tag itself and then clicking
the button in the upper right corner of the pop-up.

In this particular case, this is what gets sent to the clipboard:

```erlang
"host_id", "host_url", "host_name", "host_since", "host_location", "host_about"
```

Since steps that work with groups of variables usually need them listed like this, you can simply
paste this into your step's options and quickly get going.
