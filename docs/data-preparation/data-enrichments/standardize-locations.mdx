This function allows us to merge excerpts that refer to the same
place. This is useful when dealing with neighbourhoods or cities,
that can be mentioned in many different ways.

:::note
  This step really just calls the
  [merge_similar_spellings](/api-docs/prepare/transform/merge_similar_spellings)
  step with some predefined parameters for convenience. Check it out if you need
  more information.

## Parameters

- **Column**: column to standardize
- **Strength Threshold**: a factor in the $[0,1]$ range to make the algorithm more or less sensitive. A value of 1 will merge all ocurrences, while a value closer to 0 will search for stronger correlation between the terms, thus being much more strict with the merging.
