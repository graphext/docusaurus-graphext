Upsampling surveys is usually a good practice when there might be under (or over) represented
groups in your data. By using a scaling factor, we can adjust the influence each individual
has in the hopes of better representing the actual distribution, had we sampled indefinitely.

## Parameters

- **Weights**: numeric column with weights representing by how much this particular row's influence should be scaled
- **Minimum number of rows**: number of rows you need to have in your dataset to ensure that the weighted representation accurately reflects the population, even considering the least influential respondent
