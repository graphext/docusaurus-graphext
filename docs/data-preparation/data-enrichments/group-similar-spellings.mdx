This transformation is useful when, for example, you have freeform text in a survey,
where people will refer to the same concept in many different ways.
This helps clean and tidy your data by providing a consistent representation of each concept.

## Parameters

- **Column**: the column to search and group terms in
- **Strength threshold**: a factor in the $[0, 1]$ range to make the algorithm more or less sensitive. A value of 1 will merge all ocurrences, while a value closer to 0 will search for stronger correlation between the terms, thus being much more strict with the merging.

Let $f\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be
$F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\,dt$. Then $F$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that
$f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.
