title: "Group Similar Semantics"
description: "Group together words with similar meanings"
icon: "messages"
---

This function allows us to merge together words that mean the same. We are
talking cases like "trainers" and "sneakers", but many other cases may apply.
This helps boiling down the main message to its core, making it clearer and
more useful for models and/or other purposes.

## Parameters

- **Column**: the column to search and group terms in
- **Determine Language**: specify the language of your terms. You can either set it manually, or select a column that holds the value for each row's language.
- **Strength Threshold**: a factor in the $[0,1]$ range to make the algorithm more or less sensitive. A value of 1 will merge all ocurrences, while a value closer to 0 will search for stronger correlation between the terms, thus being much more strict with the merging.
