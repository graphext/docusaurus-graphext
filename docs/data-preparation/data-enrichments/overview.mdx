Data Enrichments are a set of functions that we can apply to our data
to upsample it, provide context, remove null values and more. These functions
provide an easy way of dealing with otherwise messier data, that can then be fed
to models or used in charts for better results.

To access enrichments, go to the Wizard -> Other -> Enrichments
