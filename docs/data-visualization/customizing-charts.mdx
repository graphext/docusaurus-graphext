## Customizing your plot

Plots can generally be highly customized. In any plot, click on the Customize button on the top right corner.

<Frame>
  ![Customize Button](/images/data-visualization/customize-button.webp)
</Frame>

This will open a menu with a myriad of options to customize your plot.

<Frame>
  ![Customize Options](/images/data-visualization/customize-options.webp)
</Frame>

### Filtering

While not immediately obvious, all the [cross filters](/concepts/graphext-concepts/cross-filters) you have currently
applied will actually show up in your plot, in real time. You can switch
to the Data tab, hone in to a thin slice of your dataset, and come back to the
Plot tab and continue editing your chart. All progress will be saved.

  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  By toggling the Customize button, you can swap between the customize panel and
  the cross filters panel. This will allow you to filter the data while seeing
  how the changes affect your chart in real time.
</Tip>
<Tip>
  Going to another tab like Data or Insights will not reset the state in Plot.
  You can navigate away safely for quick adjustments.

### Axes configuration

Depending on the nature of the variable used for a given axis and the type of chart you are working
with, some options will come up to help you shape the data and resulting visualization.

<Frame>
  ![Axes config general](/images/data-visualization/axes-config-general.webp)
</Frame>

Let's review some of the common ones:

#### Temporal Axis

<Frame>![Temporal Axis](/images/data-visualization/temporal-axis.webp)</Frame>

If the variable has a time component, the axis configuration will offer some options to aggregate data with
different "resolutions". The smaller the time unit, the finer the visualization.

Particularly for dates, some semantically sensible options are given, such as grouping for each year,
week or quarters, among others.

#### Numeric X axis

<Frame>![Numeric Axis](/images/data-visualization/numeric-axis.webp)</Frame>

If the X axis is numeric, binning options are offered based on the extent (minimum and maxium) the column
has. "Binning" means to break down the whole range of values in intervals, like _chunks_, and then seeing
how many rows lie in that interval. We can then make aggregations on each of these groups, like counting, averages, medians,
and such.

#### Numeric Y axis

If the Y axis is numeric, aggregation options

#### Categorical Axis

If the axis is categorical, we have two options to customize:

We can limit the number of categories and choose only the $n$ "top" or "bottom" values for that category.
This helps in reducing potential noise for categories that don't have much relevance in your visualization.

<Frame>
  ![Categorical
  Axis](/images/data-visualization/categorical-limit-categories.webp)
</Frame>

We can also sort these categories by some criteria, like the X axis metric, selection, ordinal or alphabetical order.

<Frame>
  ![Categorical Axis](/images/data-visualization/categorical-sorting.webp)

</Frame>

In general, this behavior is shared across the board, with some notable exceptions, like [Box plots](https://localhost:3000/documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/box-plot#axes-configuration).
All particular cases are discussed in their corresponding page.

### Themes

Themes are color and typography settings that change the look and feel of your chart. We currently
include 7 themes inspired by the most used tools and their aesthetic decisions:

- Graphext Dark
- Graphext Light
- FiveThirtyEight
- ggplot2
- Google Charts
- PowerBI
- Urban Institute

<Frame>

Example of a simple chart with all themes applied.

  <Frame>![light](/images/data-visualization/powerbi.webp)</Frame>
  <Frame>![light](/images/data-visualization/urbaninstitute.webp)</Frame>
</CardGroup>

### General Tab

The General tab holds options for changing axis names, scales, customize color segments, spacings and such.
On top of that, each plot will also display some exclusive options that may only make sense in that type of
plot.

#### Visualization & Orientation

These options are generally available in multi variable charts, like line, area, and bar charts.

The **Visualization** option allows to include more variables to compare, taking you from a simple bar chart to
a more rich grouped bar chart or stacked bar chart, for example.

The **Orientation** option allows to swap the X and Y axes to make the chart horizontal or vertical. Horizontal
charts are useful when the X axis has very long names in each tick.

<Frame>
  ![Visualization/Orientation](/images/data-visualization/viz-orientation-options.webp)
</Frame>

#### Axes Scale and Title

Axes customization of titles and scales are also generally available, where it applies. You can customize
the Y scale, and titles for each axis. If available, the color display name will change the title above the
legend for the colors.

#### Colors

When available, you can customize the color of each segment and even change the order in which they appear.

    loop
    src="/images/data-visualization/customizing-color.mp4"
  />
</Frame>

### Layout tab

The Layout tab remains mostly the same in every chart type. Here you can change the size and proportions
of the _canvas_ the chart is over.

You can also add a title, a subtitle, a description and a footer to your chart, essential when publishing
anywhere.

<Frame>![Layout Tab](/images/data-visualization/layout-tab.webp)</Frame>

### Annotations tab

The Annotations tab allows you to add little pieces of information, like value labels and statistic marks.

This tab and the behavior of the marks will change depending on the orientation and nature of your chart.

<Frame>
  ![Annotations tab](/images/data-visualization/annotations-tab.webp)
</Frame>

#### Statistics

Statistics marks are presented as a line that crosses through the independent axis at the point they represent.

They are useful to gain perspective of that the distribution of your data is.

#### Show Labels

Enables the value for each segment present in your chart. You can change the formatting and positioning.

#### Text Annotations

You may also add arbitrary text annotations wherever you want in the independent axis.

## Specific options

As previously mentioned, there are some specific customization options to each chart. For example, only the
bubble chart has the option to scale up or down the size of each data point.

You may check the specific options for each chart under their corresponding page.
