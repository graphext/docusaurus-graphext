Bar Charts are, arguably, one of the most popular types of chart. They represent relationship
between variables in a very clearly visual way, allowing to compare the height of
each bar. This makes it very easy to spot changes in your data.

There are 5 kinds of bar charts available in Graphext:

- Simple Bar Chart
- Grouped Bar Chart
- Stacked Bar Chart
- Stacked Relative Bar Chart
- Segmented Bar Chart

## Simple Bar Chart

We know how this goes.

A particularly useful, albeit common, use of bar charts is using one axis to measure the number of
ocurrences in your data. In this example, we count how many of the credit card transactions
belong to a given category and we plot that number.

  ></iframe>
</Frame>

## Grouped Bar Chart

Grouped bar charts can display all the combinations between the values of two
variables. This allows for a great way of providing a ton of information at a glance.

We can see in this example that we have a variable "**Overall skill**" which holds the values
"bad", "mid", "good" and "great", and another variable "**Wage bracket**", which holds the
values "low", "mid-low", "mid-high" and "high". This chart presents the number of players
that lie in each of the 16 possible combinations in a very tidy format.

    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
    width="800"
    height="511"
  ></iframe>
</Frame>

## Stacked Bar Chart

Stacked bar charts share a lot of similarities with grouped bar charts, with the only
difference that, instead of laying the bars laterally, they are stacked up.

The former is better to distinguish small differences in groups, the latter is
better suited for a broader perspective on the relatioship between the groups.

    title="Overall skill in relation to wage"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
    width="800"
    height="511"
  ></iframe>
</Frame>

## Stacked Relative Bar Chart

The next logical step is, of course, normalizing the values so that they add up to 1.

This gives an even better representation of the relationship in size between each group.

We can see how this vaguely resembles a [stacked area chart](documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/area-chart#stacked-relative-area-charts), albeit a
bit coarser in nature.

    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
    width="800"
    height="511"
  ></iframe>
</Frame>

## Segmented Bar Chart

Segmented bar charts behave in much the same way as [Segmented Line charts](/documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/line-chart#segmented-line-charts) do.
You get a different plot for each category displayed.

## Customizing Bar Charts

Bar Charts share much of the same functionality with [line](/documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/line-chart) and [area](/documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/area-chart) charts.

### Bar Gaps

The spacing in between each bar can be customized through the Spacing option.

</Frame>

Adjust the slider to make the bars thinner or larger.

Moreover, the spacing on either side of the chart can also be adjusted, in
case the proportions play out a bit more nicely.

### Color

Color customization for bar charts works in the same way as line charts. You can
learn more here: [Customizing color for line charts](/documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/line-chart#color).
