Area Charts behave a lot like line charts and bar charts combined. While at first glance
they can feel quite similar to a curved line chart, they are better suited to show
differences between distributions of data rather than trend evolution.

For example, in this dataset, we have a list of transactions that can either be
Income or Expenses.

Making an area chart gives a visual perspective of what the net benefit (income - expenses) is,
by visually subtracting the blue area to the orange one. Check it out live [here](https://dev-embeds.graphext.com/ef129709dac87e76/index.html?section=data).

In Graphext, you have 4 subtypes of line charts to choose from:

- Simple Area Charts
- Stacked Area Charts
- Stacked Relative Area Charts
- Segmented Area Charts

## Simple Area Chart

Old classic area chart, two variables to rule them all.

## Stacked Area Charts

As exposed in the example above, multiple area charts allow for very easy comparison
of distributions.

    title="Contribution of temperature over year"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
    width="800"
    height="511"
  ></iframe>
</Frame>

## Stacked Relative Area Charts

Staked Relative area charts normalize all their values to add up to 1. This fills the
whole Y scale, and tells you the percentage each X value occupies out of the total.

This example is the same one as above but now stretched to fill
the whole 100% range. Now we can appreciate how much each season contributes to the
overall yearly temperature in relative terms.

    title="Contribution of seasons to temperature"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
    width="800"
    height="511"
  ></iframe>
</Frame>

## Segmented Area Charts

Segmented area charts behave in much the same way as [Segmented Line charts](/documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/line-chart#segmented-line-charts) do.
You get a different plot for each category displayed.

This example is the same as the one in the beginning, but separating each Wage
bracket into its own little plot.

## Customizing Area Charts

### Color

Color customization for area charts works in the same way as with any chart.
You can learn more here: [Customizing colors in a chart](/documentation/data-visualization/customizing-charts#colors).

### Interpolation

Interpolation customization for area charts works in the same way as line charts. You can
learn more here: [Customizing interpolation for line charts](/documentation/data-visualization/types-of-chart/line-chart#interpolation).
