When dealing with data that comes from a given [integration](/integrations/data-sources/overview),
you can tell Graphext to update it recurrently, so you can
have the latest version always available and ready to be analyzed.

<Warning>
  This won't work on data that comes from a file for obvious reasons.
</Warning>

Doing this is very easy:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a proyect using an integration">
    [Set your project up](/documentation/import-and-export/data-connections) as usual, connecting your preferred integration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable recurrence">
    On the top right corner there should be a little cloud icon. Click on it to open the dropdown. At the very bottom, you can see **Recurrence: Not scheduled**. Click and continue.

    <Frame>
    ![Recurrence](/images/recurrence.webp)
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your preferred timing">

    This menu will pop up, prompting you for some settings.

    <Frame>
    ![Recurrence menu](/images/recurrence-menu.webp)
    </Frame>

    You can set up:
    - **Type of recurrence**
      - **Refresh**: will overwrite your last dataset with the new one
      - **Refresh & Backup**: will save each version of your data as a snapshot

    - **Recurrence pattern**: Define how much time will span in between updates


      When configuring a weekly, monthly or anual pattern, the beginning of the period
      starts at:
        - Weekly: every Monday
        - Monthly: every first day of the following month
        - Anually: every first day of the following year

      For hourly, daily and weekdays, the pattern just depends on the time. Weekdays will update the data
      every day except for Saturdays and Sundays.


    - **Time Zone**: you may select a different time zone if that is of your convenience
    - **Time**: exactly at what point in the period should the data be updated


    The **Next run** row will display when the pattern was first created, when was the last
    time it was updated, and when is the next update scheduled. This information will be
    populated upon saving your settings.

  </Step>
