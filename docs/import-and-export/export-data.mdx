Graphext allows you to export your data in several ways, either directly downloading it or even
exporting it to your integration of choice.

## Downloading your data

The most straightforward way to export your data is to simply donwload it.

You can download the data in 3 different ways:

1. Download the **original dataset**, without modifications
2. Download a subsection of the dataset as an **ExcelÂ®** file
3. Download a subsection of the dataset as a **CSV** file

For the last two options, this menu will pop up.

This will allow to make a selection of the columns you want to download.

As stated in the blue note, any selection you have currently applied in your data will
be used to filter the resulting download.

<Tip>
  In the case you created a graph or a model, the worflows create some utility
  columns as calculations from your data. These are excluded from the selection
  by default, but can be added back if desired.

## Exporting to an integration

In the case you have an integration setup, you can export any data to it.

For this, you have to setup **at least a project** in which the option "Allow Write Ouput" is enabled. This
project will serve as the interface through which you can export any data to it.

This will allow Graphext to have the necessary permissions to write on the specified integration.
